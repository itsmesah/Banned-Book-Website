# Banned-Book-Website
 This is a Passion Project of mine that displays my love for literature and technology. The goal is to make a book hub where it simplifies the process of finding books, even banned ones, and educated readers on why books are banned. My hope is to inform those who visit the webpage about how we can combat litereature censorship!

If anyone would like to help me improve the website by suggesting improvements or if you share the same interest as I do, I would collaborate further on the website and get this accessible to a wider audience!
